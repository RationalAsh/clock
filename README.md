Clock
======

I'm making a digital clock as a learning exercise. All the files/code related to it will be in this repo.

10/8/2014 - Update
===================

The project is coming along nicely. A lot of the initial wiring work is done. The LCD is interfaced properly with the
microcontroller and the Day of Week function is working fine. The clock even has a body now! :D 

TODO:
 * Interface buttons for changing/setting time and date
 * Cover the body in something more attractive so that it looks good
